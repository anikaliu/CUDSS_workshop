# CUDSS_workshop
Do you want to learn more about how R is used for data science? Do you want to get started learning data science yourself but are struggling to begin? Then this workshop is for you, whether you are undergraduate, graduate student or at a later stage. This hands-on workshop will introduce tidyverse, the main set of packages that are used for doing data science in R. Some coding experience might be helpful for the start but is not required. We will bring you from loading your data, pre-processing it to visualizing and identifying patterns in your data.

We will cover the following topics using some real data:
- Working with R Markdown
- Data Wrangling and Manipulation with tidyverse
- Data Visualization with ggplot2

As preparation for the workshop, please do the following steps:
1) Install R (https://cran.rstudio.com/)
2) Install RStudio (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
3) Make sure to bring your fully charged laptop!

PLEASE NOTE that all participants must also be registered members of CUDSS prior to the event, where annual membership is £4 and lifetime membership £7 and the sign up link is below! http://cudss.com/membership/
